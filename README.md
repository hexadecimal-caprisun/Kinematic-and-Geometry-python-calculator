Welcome to my kinda sorta CLI calculator for some kinematic equations and most of the geometry equations for the AP Physics Equations sheet. At the moment it only includes the equations as is, however in the future I may adjust it so that you can choose to solve for any one part of an equation, but as it stands, just for the one value for now.

Anyway, now time for the stuff on how to actually run the program

-------------------------------------------------------How to run the File--------------------------------------------------------

If you have python installed you can run it in a normal IDE or in cmd using the "python kinematic.py" command, replacing it with whatever you have the file named as, or just by leaving a shortcut somewhere.

If you do not have python installed, either go to the python website and download it there, then set it up and run as stated above, or install it from the windows store, prefereably 3.10 but 3.9 should also work for this program. Once you have it installed you can run the file as stated above.
